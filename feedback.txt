## Feedback

BigQuery AI was an excellent platform for this hackathon because it allowed me to combine SQL-native querying with AI/ML methods in a way that felt natural and efficient. Embedding reinforcement learning logic through functions like `AI.GENERATE` and `ML.FORECAST` gave me the ability to prototype intelligent, adaptive pipelines entirely inside BigQuery without heavy infrastructure overhead. The responsiveness and scalability were impressive, with sub-second turnaround times for tasks that would normally take hours. My only suggestion would be to expand documentation and examples for advanced workflows (e.g., reinforcement learning or multi-agent orchestration) so participants can more easily explore cutting-edge use cases.
